Background:
  Given I set environment variable "BUGSNAG_API_KEY" to "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"

Scenario Outline: Rails before_notify controller method works on handled errors
  Given I set environment variable "RUBY_VERSION" to "<ruby_version>"
  And I start the service "rails<rails_version>"
  And I wait for the app to respond on port "6128<rails_version>"
  When I navigate to the route "/before_notify/handled" on port "6128<rails_version>"
  Then I should receive a request
  And the request is a valid for the error reporting API
  And the request used the "Ruby Bugsnag Notifier" notifier
  And the request contained the api key "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 element
  And the exception "errorClass" equals "RuntimeError"
  And the exception "message" starts with "handled string"
  And the event "unhandled" is false
  And the event "app.type" equals "rails"
  And the event "metaData.request.url" ends with "/before_notify/handled"
  And the event "metaData.before_notify.source" equals "rails_before_handled"
  And the event "metaData.controller.name" equals "BeforeNotifyController"

  Examples:
    | ruby_version | rails_version |
    | 2.0          | 3             |
    | 2.1          | 3             |
